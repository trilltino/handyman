# This workflow automatically deploys the Handyman Marketplace application
# to Fly.io whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Create a Fly.io account and install flyctl
# 2. Create a Fly.io API token: flyctl auth token
# 3. Add the token as a GitHub secret named FLY_API_TOKEN
#    Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret
